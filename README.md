# Description

Oftenly, people write comments that they don't think that are offensive, although they're affecting other people by being rude, misogynist or simply careless.

What if there is an experimental cooking social network that lets people write down their comments, but at the time they are writing them, a notification system advise them if the comment is being polite or not.

We don't want a world (or, in this case, a social network) where everyone is rude with others.

This will also help me to practice new coding abilities, as well as, being introduce to new ones.

## Technologies
So, in this repo, I create a system to implement this idea with the help of:

- Tensorflow (of course, Python)
- MySQL
- Heroku
- Next.js (Node.js framework)

## Challenges
For the moment I'm writing this down, I am not having any difficulties, because I'm creating my environment. Although, I know they're going to be popping up as soon I start to code and learn new things.
